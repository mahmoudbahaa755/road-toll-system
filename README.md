### Project Prototype in Action:
Project Overview Video: To get an in-depth understanding of the Automated Road Gates System project idea and witness the maquette (prototype)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQZk_uqAZas] in action, please watch our project overview video.

### Features:
  1. User-friendly interface for toll booth operators to log in and manage toll collection.
  2. Automatic detection for the car type and the owner of the car
  3. Real-time tracking of vehicles entering and exiting the toll booth.
  4. Automatic toll calculation based on vehicle type 
  5. Integrated payment gateway for seamless transactions.
  6. User authentication and role-based access control for enhanced security.
### How it Works:
The Road Toll System uses AI models to automatically detect the type of vehicle passing through the toll booth. It then calculates the appropriate toll based on the vehicle type and owner. Toll booth operators can easily log in to the system and monitor the real-time tracking of vehicles entering and exiting the toll booth.
